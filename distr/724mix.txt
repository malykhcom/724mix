2. Overview

   724mix is a simple mixer with  a textmode interface for  YMF724-based sound
cards.  It  also supports  YMF724-compatible chips  such as YMF740, YMF744 and
YMF754. This mixer works in the aggressive mode only -  settings are resent to
the hardware audio CODEC of the sound  card periodically. You  can  choose the
delay between  sendings by changing the 'Resend  delay ' parameter.  A  bigger 
delay  provide  a  lower  cpu  usage,  but may way to longer periods of  wrong
sound level. The default delay is 100 msecs.
   724mix  can  switch some AC'97 compatible features such as 'Mono to Stereo'
(Simulated Stereo), 'Bass Boost' (Loudness), '3D Mode' (3D Stereo Enhancement)
in  case  if  the audio  CODEC  of the  sound  card  supports  this  features. 
Otherwise message  'Not supported by the CODEC' or  'No 3D Stereo Enhancement' 
will be written.
